# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Algorithms** playground!  
This repository is a collection of hands-on implementations of popular ML algorithms, all built in Python (mostly with ðŸ’š Jupyter/Colab).

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Each folder/notebook demonstrates a specific algorithm with explanations, math intuition, and code.

- ðŸŒ² **Decision Trees** â€“ From root to leaf, splitting like itâ€™s 1996  
- ðŸŒ³ **Random Forests** â€“ Bagging trees for stability  
- ðŸª„ **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / AdaBoost** â€“ Boosting performance, literally  
- ðŸ“‰ **Gradient Descent** â€“ Because optimization is life  
- ðŸ“Š **Linear & Logistic Regression** â€“ The OGs of ML  
- ðŸ§© **K-Means & Clustering** â€“ Grouping things like Spotify playlists  
- ðŸ“š **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** â€“ Surprisingly not so naÃ¯ve  
- ðŸ¤– **Support Vector Machines** â€“ Drawing optimal boundaries in style  
- ðŸŽ² **Ensemble Learning** â€“ Because teamwork makes the dream work
