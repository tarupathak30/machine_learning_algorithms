# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Algorithms** playground!  
This repository is a collection of hands-on implementations of popular ML algorithms, all built in Python (mostly with 💚 Jupyter/Colab).

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder/notebook demonstrates a specific algorithm with explanations, math intuition, and code.

- 🌲 **Decision Trees** – From root to leaf, splitting like it’s 1996  
- 🌳 **Random Forests** – Bagging trees for stability  
- 🪄 **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / AdaBoost** – Boosting performance, literally  
- 📉 **Gradient Descent** – Because optimization is life  
- 📊 **Linear & Logistic Regression** – The OGs of ML  
- 🧩 **K-Means & Clustering** – Grouping things like Spotify playlists  
- 📚 **Naïve Bayes** – Surprisingly not so naïve  
- 🤖 **Support Vector Machines** – Drawing optimal boundaries in style  
- 🎲 **Ensemble Learning** – Because teamwork makes the dream work
